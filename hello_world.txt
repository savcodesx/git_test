HEYYYYYY! I have to relearn this part because I'm and idiot
and went to long without learning. WILL NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE
AGAIN.
To be SO fair though, I've been absolutley obsessed with
EPIC: The Musical and now can't stop thinking about Greek Mythology
which is funny because Odin is like, THE Norse god lamooo.
Anyways, hi :D
